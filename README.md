Project: RIDE

Problem statement 
The number of people who ride buses in kigali is very large. More than 10000 people go to various places including their work places. Now the problem arises when they have to wait for a bus for a long time without knowing if it will come or not, and you find that they have reached their work late.

Solution
We are creating an application where people can book a bus, and know the time it will take the bus to reach a certain bus stop. .

Target Market: 
Our customers will be these people who use buses for their daily  activities and those who mostly take long to get to work in the morning and also who take buses while going home.

The mode of payment will be through cashless payment because people will book and pay or they will choose to get to the bus stop right before it alives.

In case the person who booked is late and he/she finds that their bus is full they are going to have to take the next one but  not pay the fare again, they will just show the message confirming their booking. But if he/she misses the next bus to the one booked, the booking will be cancelled.

Competitors: 
Our biggest competitors are our customers. Those people who will think that booking is a waste of time and those who still prefer to stand in a line rather than booking and reaching there on time.

Technologies: 
 Tools that we will use to build our project:
GPS locator: for locating the bus
Obstacle sensor: to count the number of people in entering the bus
